SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8888/callback
```

### YouTube Data API v3 Credentials

1. Create a Google Cloud Project
    - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
    - Sign in with your Google account
    - Click on the project dropdown (top-left corner) and select "New Project"
    - Enter a project name and click "Create"
    - Select your new project from the project dropdown

2. Enable YouTube Data API v3
    - In the Google Cloud Console, go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
    - Search for "YouTube Data API v3"
    - Click on the API and then click "Enable"

3. Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials
    - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
    - Click "Create Credentials" and select "OAuth client ID"
    - If prompted, configure the OAuth consent screen:
    - Choose "External" user type (or "Internal" if you have a Google Workspace account)
    - Fill in the required fields (App name, User support email, Developer contact information)
    - You can skip optional fields for now
    - Add the scope: `../auth/youtube` (for managing YouTube account)
    - Add test users if you're using external user type
    - For application type, select "Desktop app"

4. Download and Place Credentials
    - After creating the credentials, you'll see a dialog with your Client ID and Client Secret
    - Click "Download JSON"
    - Save this file as `client_secret.json` in your project directory

5. Use Credentials in the Script
    - Ensure `client_secret.json` is in the same directory as your script
    - The script will use this file for YouTube authentication

By completing these steps, you'll have the necessary credentials to access both the Spotify API and the YouTube Data API v3, allowing SpotiTube Sync to transfer playlists between the platforms.
